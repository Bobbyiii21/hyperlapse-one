                Throughout my time in VEX Robotics, I have created multiple various
                projects using VEXCode Pro V5 and PROS. These projects include robot builds
                and their respective autonomous and driver control code. My most recent
                project includes code for the 2023-2024 VEX Robotics Competition Game,

                MyPlanter is a project that I, along with a team of two others, designed,
                built, and programmed for the GHP 60 Engineering Expo. The puropse of the
                project was to create a flower pot that could self-water, as well as monitor
                the soil moisture, light levels, and temperature. The project was built using
                a custom 3D printed flower pot and an Arduino Uno Wi-Fi Rev2. The software
                was written in C++ and Python. The companion app was written in React Native.

                SmartGlass is a device that I designed, built, and programmed for science and engineering fairs during the 2023-2024 school year.
                The device presents a novel and low-cost solution to assist people with Dementia. The device is a head-mounted system equipped with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, Raspberry Pi Camera 3, and three tactile buttons. The device can detect objects in diverse environments using computer vision and QR (Quick Response) codes. Based on the user's input, the device can relay information to the user audibly through bone conduction technology.
